Following the guide, we'll learn how to make web extensions for firefox from start to finish.
This particular tutorial extension adds a red border to "mozilla.org" pages or any of its subdomains.

Writing the extension:

make a folder named borderify
create a file name manifest.json
instert this boilerplate into the manifest file:
    {
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "name": "Borderify",
    "version": "1.0",

    "description": "Adds a red border to all webpages matching mozilla.org.",

    "icons": {
        "48": "icons/border-48.png"
    },

    "content_scripts": [
        {
        "matches": ["*://*.mozilla.org/*"],
        "js": ["borderify.js"]
        }
    ]
    }

Create the "icons" folder directly under the "borderify" folder.
Save an icon there named "border-48.png". 
    If you choose to supply your own icon, It should be 48x48 pixels. 
    You could also supply a 96x96 pixel icon, for high-resolution displays, and if you do this it will be specified as the 96 property of the icons object in manifest.json:
        "icons": {
            "48": "icons/border-48.png",
            "96": "icons/border-96.png"
            }
